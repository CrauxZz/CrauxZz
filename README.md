👋 Hi, I'm @CrauxZz

👀 I'm interested in digital art and video game and film production.

🌱 I'm currently learning Python, C, and Java to improve my programming skills, also i'm learning more about game development, specifically in Unity and Unreal Engine.

💞️ I'm looking to collaborate on projects related to game development, film production, digital art, 3D art, and animation. I'm always open to learning new things and expanding my skill set.
